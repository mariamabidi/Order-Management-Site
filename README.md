# Order-Management-Site

This project showcases a real-time Order Management System (OMS) leveraging Redis, MongoDB, and Python to optimize inventory tracking and order processing. By utilizing Redis's in-memory architecture, the system achieves ultra-low latency for real-time updates, stock level adjustments, and order processing. Key features include:

 - Inventory Management: Real-time stock tracking using Redis data structures like Sets, Lists, and Sorted Sets.
 - Order Processing: Redis Streams enable continuous processing of incoming orders.
 - Analytics & Insights: Aggregated data using Redis Sorted Sets provides insights into inventory trends and customer demands.
 - Alert System: Low-stock alerts with Redis Pub/Sub and email notifications using Python's smtplib.
 - Persistence: Hybrid persistence with Redis RDB snapshots and AOF logging ensures data integrity.

This project highlights Redis's flexibility, speed, and scalability in handling real-time, high-throughput operations essential for modern e-commerce platforms.
